Description: # iwspp
        Preprocessing workflow for pathology slides
        
        Pathology images are heterogeneous with widely varying staining intensities, tissue content 
        and background artefacts. Current CNN require high-quality examples to achieve good results. 
        iwspp implements several preprocessing workflows that can be generalised to these slides
        
        
        # Installation and running the tool
        The best way to get iwspp along with all the dependencies is to install the release with python package installer (pip)
        
        ```pip install iwspp```
        or 
        ```pip install /iwspp/dist/iwspp-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl```
        This will add iwspp command line argument with -t for switching.
        
        High number >2 -t options require the lower level analysis to work if starting scratch.
        
        | Options | Context | Usage |
        | ---    | --- | --- |
        | t = 1 | SVS to small size images (.jpeg .png) | ```iwspp -t 1``` |
        | t = 2 | Tissue segmentation | ```iwspp -t 2``` | 
        | t = 3 | Tissue tilling | ```iwspp -t 3``` |
        | t = 4 | Stain normalisation | ```iwspp -t 4``` |
        
        Utility functions can be imported using conventional python system like ```from iwspp.Normalize import Macenko```
